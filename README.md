# 🎓 uniOrganizer
# Student life made simple!

### uniOrganizer is a mobile app designed with students in mind, combining all the essential features for managing studies into one intuitive tool. The app allows users to store lecture notes, track tasks, monitor deadlines, and manage grades for individual subjects. Thanks to integration with the user's class schedule (via iCal file import), the timetable is always up-to-date. The app offers both dark and light modes, as well as the option to personalize subject colors, making organization easier and navigation faster. <br><br><br>
